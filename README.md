The firmware is configured for the 168 chip adruins.

Connection to the legs, see the firmware.

A stepper driver is connected via an adapter for ease of use, a driver such as A4988 or something similar.

Power 12 volts, Adruin via VIN too.

The driver on the 5 volt line is powered by adruins.

cathodes of LED assembly diodes are assembled in a heap and through 1Kom Adruins are connected to the ground.

Any stepper motor, but in this model as in the picture step drive \ PM35L-D48-HPH7-.JPG
this step must be corrected, in the original form, the windings at the midpoint are combined (cut windings.png), cutting is required ...
as in the picture cut windings stepper motor.png and cut off the excess wire as unnecessary ...

the code is not "licked" and thrown in haste ...))))


///////////
COMMENT!!!
The rotary axis in the hinged module should be changed with the axis of the latches, this is a design error ...
